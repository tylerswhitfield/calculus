If you already have Mathematica installed 'project.nb' should load without a hitch.

If Mathematica is not installed on the computer you're using, Wolfram Alpha supplies a browser plugin reader for their .cdf "computer document format".

I've provided the installation on this flash drive 'CDFPlayer_9.0.1_WIN.exe' but it's also available at 
'https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/'
After installation it should allow the .cdf version of the document to be opened and maybe the more robust .nb 'notebook', file native to Mathematica.
